# python-art-decoder
A simple program to decode the art numbers from the output of python art library to a string representation of the actual number.

## Usage

import the ```art_num_to_string_standard``` function in ```art_decode.py``` to convert output from the art library ```text2art``` function with standard font back into a text. Works only for numbers.

## Dependencies

Nothing really, you just need the art library for the test script.

## Status of Project

I personally will not actively work on adding more support but feel free to contribute if you want.
